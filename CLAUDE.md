# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note:** The comprehensive agent instructions have been moved to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Please refer to that file for detailed documentation about:
- Essential commands (building, testing, linting)
- Architecture and core components
- Policy evaluation and rule filtering system
- VSA (Verification Summary Attestation) functionality
- Testing strategy and acceptance test framework
- Development environment setup and troubleshooting
- Special considerations (CGO/DNS resolution, multi-architecture support, rule filtering)

This file is kept for backward compatibility. All future updates should be made to AGENTS.md.
