Feature: validate input server mode
  The ec command line should be able to run as a persistent HTTP server
  for policy evaluation

  Background:
    Given stub git daemon running

  Scenario: server mode evaluation with passing policy
    Given a git repository named "happy-day-config" with
      | policy.yaml | examples/happy_config.yaml |
    Given a git repository named "happy-day-policy" with
      | main.rego | examples/happy_day.rego |
    When ec server is started with "validate input --server --policy git::https://${GITHOST}/git/happy-day-config.git"
    And a POST request is sent to the server at "/v1/validate/input" with body
    """
    {
      "apiVersion": "tekton.dev/v1",
      "kind": "Pipeline",

      "spec": {"tasks": [{"name": "appstudio-init", "taskRef": {"name": "init", "version": "0.1"}}]}
    }
    """
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response field "success" should be "true"
    And the response should match the snapshot

  Scenario: server mode evaluation with violations
    Given a git repository named "multiple-sources-config" with
      | policy.yaml | examples/multiple_sources_config.yaml |
    Given a git repository named "spam-policy" with
      | main.rego | examples/spam.rego |
    Given a git repository named "ham-policy" with
      | main.rego | examples/ham.rego |
    When ec server is started with "validate input --server --policy git::https://${GITHOST}/git/multiple-sources-config.git"
    And a POST request is sent to the server at "/v1/validate/input" with body

  Scenario: server mode health endpoints
    Given a git repository named "happy-day-config" with
      | policy.yaml | examples/happy_config.yaml |
    Given a git repository named "happy-day-policy" with
      | main.rego | examples/happy_day.rego |
    When ec server is started with "validate input --server --policy git::https://${GITHOST}/git/happy-day-config.git"
    And a GET request is sent to the server at "/live"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should contain "ok"
    And the response should match the snapshot

  Scenario: server mode evaluation with YAML input
    Given a git repository named "happy-day-config" with
      | policy.yaml | examples/happy_config.yaml |
    Given a git repository named "happy-day-policy" with
      | main.rego | examples/happy_day.rego |
    When ec server is started with "validate input --server --policy git::https://${GITHOST}/git/happy-day-config.git"
    And a POST request is sent to the server at "/v1/validate/input" with content type "application/yaml" and body
